# levelground-remake

Hi, this here is my remake of a random website. The purpose was to recreate the website to the best of my ability using my (current) knowledge of HTMl and Css.

### how it's made? 
<b> Langs Used</b> Html5 CSS3

The emphasis on this project has everything to do with formatting. I played around heavily with the padding, margin and float properties of each element to get them in the exact position i wanted them to be in. It was a very simple layout to do, in the grand scheme of things. 

### Optimizations

If you want to, I would love for someone to take a look at the css and see if there is a way to more cleanly construct my code. I can be a bit sporadic when I'm coding, so sometimes the selectors can be all over the place because I saw something that needed a change in that moment. 

### Lessons Learned

to never float an object right if you want it's position to be right. Just float it left, and position it there. Another Thing: you have to be very careful when playing around with margin and nesting tags.
